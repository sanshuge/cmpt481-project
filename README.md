•	Title: redesign The Home Depot products item menu using deep menu and wide menu.
•	Name: Ruobing Fu( xdt709)
•	Interaction problem :
Poor navigation structures are a common problem with online purchasing, which increases customer frustrations and lowers sales. In particular, the way products are arranged into wide menu structures (more items per level, fewer levels) or deep menu structures (fewer items per level, more levels) greatly aﬀects how quickly and easily users may search and choose products. For retail stores like the Home Depot and Ikea, they have a huge inventory, so it is crucial to have simple and clear navigation structure enabling both unprofessional(eg: home owners) and professionals (eg: contractors, business owner )
•	Interaction technique:
The plan includes designing, implementing, and testing two interactive menu systems: Deep menu and wide menu. Deep menu will start with outdoor and indoor, and I will combine some departments to make the hierarchy deeper. Wide menu: the menu will be sorted by the departments, and the deepest level would be level 3, and the width will be 24. Also, I will integrate the state machine in the system so it would be easier to use and evaluate the system.
•	Tools and resources:
Language: processing java Software: processing.
Datasets: The Home Depot department lists and partial product lists.
•	Outline of activities:
Gather data from the Home Depot website.
Go through the existing menu structures and find the best practice. Design the interactive system and development.
User testing.
Compare diﬀerent structure and evaluation by diﬀerent target users.
•	Milestone 1:
Collect all the data needed from the website.
Finalize the design for both wide and deep menus and the user interaction tracking system. Evaluate the design.
Begin development of the interactive menu systems, focusing on basic navigation functionality

•	Milestone 2:
Complete the development of both menu systems, including all intended features for testing. Add a tracking system for users for evaluation.
Collect user interaction data.
•	Risks:
1.	It is kind of difficult to find various target users, for example, I don’t know any contractors or business owners who visit the Home Depot a lot and are familiar with the products. So I won’t be able to collect data from them.
2.	Potential limitations in tracking detailed user interactions accurately. Workaround: Implement custom event tracking and logging to capture nuanced user behaviors.(timer and user cursor movement logging)
•	Evaluation:
1.	Experiments: Participants are asked to perform specific tasks, such as finding a particular item using the menu system. Ensure that each participant interacts with both menu types under similar conditions.
2.	Observations: Watch participants as they use the menu systems, making note of their navigation strategies, hesitations, errors, and any feedback they verbally express.
3.	Questionnaires: Collect subjective feedback from participants regarding their experience using the wide and deep menus.
