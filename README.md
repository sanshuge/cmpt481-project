•	Title: redesign The Home Depot products item menu using deep menu and wide menu.


•	Name: Ruobing Fu( xdt709)


•	Interaction problem :

Poor navigation structures are a common problem with online purchasing, which increases customer frustrations and lowers sales. In particular, the way products are arranged into wide menu structures (more items per level, fewer levels) or deep menu structures (fewer items per level, more levels) greatly aﬀects how quickly and easily users may search and choose products. For retail stores like the Home Depot and Ikea, they have a huge inventory, so it is crucial to have simple and clear navigation structure enabling both unprofessional(eg: home owners) and professionals (eg: contractors, business owner )

•	Interaction technique:

The plan includes designing, implementing, and testing two interactive menu systems: Deep menu and wide menu. Deep menu will start with outdoor and indoor, and I will combine some departments to make the hierarchy deeper. Wide menu: the menu will be sorted by the departments, and the deepest level would be level 3, and the width will be 24. Also, I will integrate the state machine in the system so it would be easier to use and evaluate the system.

•	Tools and resources:

Language: processing java Software: processing.
Datasets: The Home Depot department lists and partial product lists.
